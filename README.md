# The Issue Tracker for RapidFTR

We're using this single repository's Issues page to track all work items for RapidFTR. This process itself is new to us, so any feedback (like organizing labels, using assignees, etc) is welcome.

* Check the [Waffle](https://waffle.io/rapidftr/tracker) board
* Pick up an issue
  * For people new to the codebase, we recommend starting issues labelled **Small** or **Tech Tasks**
* Mark it as **In Dev** or **In QA**, so that nobody else signs up for it
* Send a pull request to the appropriate Web or Android repository, and reference this issue
  * GitHub can [cross-reference issues](https://github.com/blog/967-github-secrets)
* Label the issue as **Dev Complete** or **QA Complete**
* Announce your contribution in the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rapidftr)!
